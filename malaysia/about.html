		<h1>Meet the Team!</h1>
		
		<p>Hello! My name is Jia Wern Chong and I’m an international student here at Rutgers University! I’m currently a junior majoring in computer science.</p>
		
		<p>I decided to dedicate my blog towards my home country, Malaysia as not many people know of Malaysia. When someone mentions about Southeast Asia, the first country that comes to mind would usually be either Singapore, Vietnam or the Philippines. I’m hoping that this website would change that and would allow more people to know of/or about Malaysia, it's culture, background and people!</p>
		
		<p>I hope you enjoy reading my site!</p>
