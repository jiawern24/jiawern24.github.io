		<p>Hi everyone! Nice to meet you all! I'm Jia Wern but feel free to call me jw for short. I'm currently a junior at Rutgers University, majoring in Computer Science!</p>
		
		<p>In my free time, I like to indulge in two of my favourite hobbies: listening to music and play games. When it comes to music, I really enjoy the pop genre, particularly K-Pop and J-Pop. As for games, one game that Ive been active on and really enjoy is "<a href = "https://www.thatskygame.com/" target = "_blank">  Sky: Children of the Light</a>". It's a very relaxing and beautiful game where you can explore around the world of Sky, make new friends from around the world, have fun with friends and more! Unlike most popular or trending games, this game isn't a hero shooter video game, battle arena that requires a lot of strategic thinking. Sky is more of a adventure and exploration game where you can just have fun, hang out with friends, collect cool costumes, masks, etc for your avatar (typically called Sky kid by players). If you're looking for a fun relaxing game where you can unwind after a tiring day of classes, you should definitely try playing Sky!</p>
