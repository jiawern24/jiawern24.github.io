		<h3 id="armeniant">Armenian Street</h3>
		<img src="images/armenian1.png" alt="Armenian Street view">
		<img src="images/armenian2.png" alt="Charity performance">
		<p> A narrow street in George Town, home to the famous “Children on a Bicycle” mural and also various street arts. There’s a lot of shops and roadside stalls/vendors selling handmade stuffs from clothes to keychains. There will also be live performances and buskings, especially on the weekends. It’s exceptionally busy on the weekends and especially during holidays so it’s not recommended if you are just interested in exploring the street art, buildings, cafes and museum, as it’ll be packed with people and tourists. However, I do recommend going there at least once during peak days to experience the lively vibe there! </p>

		<h3 id="duriant">Balik Pulau Durian</h3>
		<img src="images/durian1.png" alt="Durian Stall">
		<img src="images/durian2.png" alt="Basket of Durian">
		<p>Here is where you can find the best durian in Penang. The durian season is between May to August and Balik Pulau is the best place to go if you’re looking for some delicious and affordable durians. There are many varieties of durians with Musang King being the most sought out durian. The Musang King has a sweeter and creamier texture compared to the other variety. You can buy them whole and experience opening one yourself or you can have them open it for you! The fruit might either have a pleasantly sweet fragrance or have an aroma that is unpleasant to some. Despite that, I still definitely recommend adding it to your bucket list when you visit Penang or Malaysia especially if you’ve never tried it before.</p>

		<h3 id="ferringhit">Batu Ferringhi Beach</h3>
		<img src="images/ferringhi1.png" alt="Almost sunset photo">
		<img src="images/ferringhi2.png" alt="Seaside view">
		<p>Batu Ferringhi is the best area to go to for beach goers and photographers! Here along the coast at Batu Ferringhi, you can find multiple beaches, resorts, restaurants and many more. I personally really enjoy going to the beaches in Batu Ferringhi because it feels like an escape from my busy life. Many of the restaurants nearby serve fresh seafood and most of them offer outdoor seating so you can enjoy the breeze and scenery while you eat. Usually my family and I enjoy going there during sunset as the scenery and atmosphere there is really calming and breathtaking.</p>

		<h3 id="beacht">Beach Street</h3>
		<img src="images/beach1.png" alt="Occupy Beach Street">
		<img src="images/beach2.png" alt="Beach Street">
		<p>Beach Street, the oldest road in Penang, is also another popular street in George Town. Home to many of the Malaysian and international bank headquarters in Penang, the commercial buildings showcase the British colonial architectures, combining the modern lifestyles with the old nostalgic buildings and road. On every Sunday, there is an event called Occupy Beach Street, where the street will be closed to cars. My family really loves to come here every week. It is similar to the farmers market in the US, where there’s vendors/stalls selling handmade stuff, food and drinks but there are more activities that can be done like face painting, caricature drawing, henna drawing, some carnival games and many more.This event is family friendly and it is a great way to spend your weekends!</p>

		<h3 id="batikt">Craft Batik</h3>
		<img src="images/batik1.png" alt="Dyed batik left to dry">
		<img src="images/batik2.png" alt="Designing batik">
		<img src="images/batik3.png" alt="Batik that is sold">
		<p>Here at Craft Batik, you have the chance to get a glimpse into the production of Batik, a process of hand dyeing fabrics and using wax in certain areas to form a design. The batik making process is really long and is labor intensive to produce so usually handmade one’s with unique designs are more expensive. You can get a tour of the batik workshop and get to see how the beautiful and unique batik is made from scratch. Up front in the shop you’ll have the chance to buy many handmade batik products ranging from clothes to keychains. I definitely recommend people to come here if they want to get some unique handmade products that’s unique to Malaysia! I’ve bought a few of them as souvenirs for my foreign friends before.</p>

		<h3 id="hinbust">Hin Bus Depot</h3>
		<img src="images/hinbus1.png" alt="Hin Bus Depot entrance">
		<img src="images/hinbus2.png" alt="Vendors">
		<p>Recently, Hin Bus Depot has been a popular place for young adults to hang out at on the weekends. There would be many entrepreneurs, small business owners, craftsmen, artisans, musicians and performers of all kinds to showcase their products, crafts and talents. You’ll get the chance to discover new vendors every weekend. Even though the vendors are only there on the weekends, you can still check out the many cafes around the area. Many of them are very instagrammable and they serve good eats as well! My friends and I would frequent the place trying out new stuff every weekend.</p>

		<h3 id="templet">Kek Lok Si</h3>
		<img src="images/temple1.png" alt="Kek Lok Si on regular days/during the day">
		<img src="images/temple2.png" alt="Kek Lok Si during CNY">
		<p>Kek Lok Si, the largest Buddhist temple in Malaysia. During Chinese New Year, the temple will remain open until late at night with thousands of lights and lanterns displayed for 30 days after CNY. Many tourists usually plan their vacation to align with the CNY celebration to be able to witness the event that only happens once a year. My family and I would visit the temple occasionally to pray. You can either drive up to the temple or walk along the winding steps leading up to the temple. I definitely recommend walking up there as there are shops along the steps selling souvenirs and also religious paraphernalias.</p>

		<h3 id="foodt">Pek Kong Cheng</h3>
		<img src="images/food1.png" alt="Pek Kong Cheng food court">
		<p>This is a newly opened food court area located at Tua Pek Kong Temple in Bukit Mertajam. I personally have yet to visit there as it just recently opened around the summer/fall last year but my family said that it's a must go place if you're in the area. There’s a variety of food and drink stalls all located within the temple’s vicinity. I will be visiting the place over summer when I go back so I’ll share more about my experience then!</p>
